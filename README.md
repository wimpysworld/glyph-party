## 🎭 The Story

Tired of hunting through nightmarish Unicode search websites that look like they were designed in 1995? So was I. After spending way too long trying to find the perfect symbols for a terminal app, I decided enough was enough 👿

**Glyph Party** is what happens when a developer gets fed up with ugly interfaces tuat are awkward to use and decides to build something better instead. It's Unicode search, but ✨*pretty*✨ and easy to use.

## 🚀 What You Get

- **10,000+ carefully curated glyphs** perfect for terminal UIs, no [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) required
- **AI-generated descriptions** for each glyph to help make the search easier
- **Instant search** that actually works (shocking, I know)
- **Click to copy** any character (because life's too short for manual selection)
- **Catppuccin Mocha theme** that won't burn your retinas
- **Categories & blocks** for when you know roughly what you want
- **Click for details** including Unicode codes and HTML entities
- **Responsive design** that works on your phone too

## ⚡ Quick Start

### The Lazy Way (Recommended) 💪

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/glyph-party.git
cd glyph-party
just setup    # Installs deps + builds Unicode data
just dev      # Starts server + opens browser
```

### The Manual Way 🤦‍♂️

```bash
npm install
npm run build:data
npm run dev
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 16+, Python 3, and a sense of style.

> [!TIP]
> The browser code uses ES modules. Serve the site over HTTP, for example with `just dev`, instead of opening `src/index.html` from disk.

> [!NOTE]
> To generate descriptions for glyphs using AI, you'll need a Google Gemini API key and `uv` installed. You can install `uv` with this command:
>
> ```bash
> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
> ```
>
> Now, create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key. Copy the provided `.env.example` file as a starting point:
>
> ```bash
> cp .env.example .env
> ```
>
> Then, add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file. After that, you can run:
>
> ```bash
> just generate-descriptions
> ```

## 🛠️ Just Commands

Using [just](https://github.com/casey/just) because Makefiles are so last decade:

```bash
just setup                  # Complete setup for new projects
just dev                    # Start development server + open browser
just serve                  # Start development server only
just build                  # Generate fresh Unicode data
just clean                  # Remove generated Unicode data files
just rebuild                # Clean + build fresh data
just generate-descriptions  # Generate AI descriptions for glyphs
just stats                  # Show project statistics
just check                  # Verify everything's working
just help                   # List every recipe
```

## 🚀 Deployment

Designed for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) but works anywhere static sites are welcome.

GitHub Actions deploys the site with the reusable `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` workflow:

- Pull requests from this repository deploy a preview and add the preview URL as a PR comment.
- Stable SemVer tags, such as `1.2.3`, deploy production from `main`.
- The workflows expect `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` repository secrets.

For a manual Cloudflare Pages setup, use:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `src`

## 🎯 Perfect For

- CLI tools that need visual flair
- Terminal UIs with personality
- Documentation that doesn't suck
- Any project that deserves better than `*` and `-`

## 📊 Stats

- **10,616** hand-picked characters
- **22** categories of awesome
- **199** Unicode blocks
